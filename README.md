In the file question3.asm, this was basically part of an assignment that had to be done in Assembly Language. 
In overall, this question asks the user how many lines of input he/she wishes to insert. Say 4. Then the user is expected to give 4 positive integers, 
however, the user can choose to put in '=0' as an input (in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th entry) which would make reference to the value in the first entry. 
The value in the first entry then gets put as well in the entry that had input and similarly applies for other lines of input. 
The result then addds all the values attained and displays the result/sum.

This was the question (out of three) in the assignment I was most proud of, given that it required logic and patience - both of which I think I can be quite good at 
under the right environment or circumstances.
